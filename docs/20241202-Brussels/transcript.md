# Transcript of the video

Welcome to Belgium and to Brussels.

Let me use some of your time to convince you that Belgium is a truly exciting
country and that it is worth spending some time in Brussels if you arrive
early or leave late.

**next slide**

Let's first get oriented.

**click** Here is our meeting venue. It is the building of the Fund for
Scientific Research, the main funding organisation in Flanders, the Dutch
speaking part of Belgium, for fundamental science, large research infrastructures
and some applied research.

**click** Here is the central station where most of you probably arrived
by train from the airport. Brussels is really a city in the valley of 
the river known as Zenne in Dutch or Senne in French and on both sides
you have not very high but sometimes steep hills. The Central Station is in 
the valley while the meeting venue is a bit higher on a low hill already
as you will experience when you walk from the city centre where most
hotels are to the meeting venue.

**click** And here is the market square, called the Grote Markt in Dutch or
Grande-Place in French. It is definitely worth a visit, also after dark
when it is beautifully illuminated. And in this time of the year there is a 
short light show every half hour between 5 and 10pm.

**click** Brussels isn't really a large city. It is a collection of villages
grown together through the years and only some of those villages have actually
united to form the city of Brussels. What we know as Brussels is actually the
Brussels Capital Region which still contains 19 municipalities.

One area of Brussels is called "the Pentagon" and looking at the map, it is 
immediately clear why this is the case. It is the area surrounded by big lanes
and a canal with a more or less pentagonal shape. One could argue that there
are six sides, but then as names often come up after some beer in Belgium,
we can excuse for that. This is really the centre of Brussels, though
nowadays the actual Municipality of Brussels does contain some areas outside
of the pentagon.

**click** Our meeting venue is just next to the Belgian Parliament. In fact, 
the work entrance of the Senate is just opposite the main entrance of HOEK38.
However, we all know that there is more than one parliament in Brussels as
there is also the European Parliament which you see **click** here.

Now an outsider may be excused to think that this is it, but this would be
way too simple for Belgium. In fact, there is saying that if you think you
understand Belgium, someone explained it to you wrongly.

We've had big fights between language groups, especially in the late '60s and '70s
of the previous century, and we felt the need to split the country by
introducing an extra level of government for certain matters and turn
Belgium into a federal country.
Of course, we could never agree on how to do it, and there were two proposals.
The Dutch speaking wanted to split Belgium according to language in 3 communities,
while the French speaking wanted a division in three non-overlapping regions: Wallonia,
Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region. Each structure with its own parliament and 
government.

In Flanders we rationalised quickly and merged the parliaments for the Dutch speaking
community and Flanders into one, which you see **click** here. It is also almost 
right next to our venue. So we've already found three parliaments in Brussels.

But there is more. **click** Here you see the parliament of the French-speaking
community and **click** here is the parliament of the Brussels Capital Region.

So we've already found five parliaments but obviously we're still missing some
if we look at the subdivision of Brussels. Moreover, 7 is a biblical number and not 
5 and Belgium has a history as a catholic country.

**next slide**

There are two more parliaments outside of Brussels.

**click** The parliament of the Walloon Region is in Namur while
**click** the parliament of the German-speaking community is in a small city 
called Eupen opposite from the football stadium of the local team.

**next slide**

Now going back to Brussels, I thought I had found all parliaments we have in
Belgium, but it turns out there is actually a sixth one in Brussels.

**click** There is also the "Parlaiment Francophone Bruxellois" which is
not separately elected, but is still a separate administrative entity.
It consists of all French-speaking members of the parliament of the 
Brussels Capital Region and has some unique matters it can decide upon.
To try to understand why you'll probably need some of the Belgian
medicine that we promoted with the meeting announcement.

**next slide**

So we see Brussels is really an administrative city.

**click** As the capital of the Kingdom of Belgium, it is also
home to the Royal Palace which we find on the opposite side of the 
nearby park. 
When the government resigns, the Prime Minister first goes to Parliament, 
and can then walk through the park to the King to offer the government's resignation. 

That park is a remainder of the former hunting grounds of the
**click** Coudenberg Palace. This was a huge palace towering over Brussels,
built starting in the 11th century, where also Charles V often staid. 
It burned down in 1731 and was never rebuilt. Nowadays you can still visit 
the basements of the building which have been turned into an interesting
museum. The entrance is in the building right from the Royal Palace.

Now that we are looking around in this area, there is another interesting
building to show how fascinating Belgium can be. Let's have a look at
its most famous, or should I see infamous, renovation project.

**click**

The Palace of Justice was built around 1880 by order of the second king of 
Belgium, Leopold II, who built many monumental buildings in Brussels.
Renovation works started in 1987 and the building was entirely put in
scaffolding. However, money ran out quickly after putting the scaffolding,
which was actually rented, and the renovation hardly proceeded until recently.
Before they could restart the renovation works, the scaffolding itself had to
be renovated as it was not safe for use anymore. The work is now expected
to take until around 2040. However, from the square in front of the Palace of Justice,
you have a good view over Brussels, so it may be worth walking to there and
then take the elevator to go back to the lower parts. There is also a ferris
wheel that can give you an even better view. From there you'll also see
a monumental church, the Koekelberg Basilica, which is said to be the fifth
largest Christian church in the world. Planning and early construction
also started under Leopold II, but the plans where way too expensive and
were changed completely after the first world war, giving the church a 20th 
century Art Deco architecture. It was only completed around 1950.

**next slide**

Now if you think you've had it all, you're wrong.

Brussels has a strange fascination with peeing statues.

**click** The most famous one is Manneken Pis. The current statue
dates back to 1619, but it is likely that there was one before that 
already, and in those days the fountain may also have been used as
a way to distribute drinking water.

There are many legends surrounding this statue, one claiming that it
was in honour of a little boy saving the city by peeing from the city walls
on a fuse from a charge of gunpowder and thus saved the city.
It is actually more likely that the statue was simply made in honour
of the leather tanneries in that area of Brussels. In those days,
human urine was used as a source of ammonia needed for the tanning 
process, and children's pee was preferred.

**click** In 1987 some salesmen in a dead end street commissioned a 
statue of a little girl peeing, to attract more people to their street.
It did work and one side of the street is now basically a giant 
and very touristic Belgian beer bar. 
The statue stands in a side street of the Rue des Bouchers, 
perhaps the biggest tourist trap in Brussels in terms of restaurants.

**click** In 1998 the statue of Zinneke pis, actually called
"Het Zinneke", was constructed. Zinneke is currently a nickname for those
people living in Brussels but not born there, 
but it likely actually refers to times in the 16th century when people
used dogs to chase rats that were responsible for the Black Plague.
Soon there were way too many dogs roaming through the city,
and it is said that people killed dogs without owner by drowning
them in the Zenne, the river flowing through Brussels.
**click** Nowadays the river is completely covered in Brussels, 
but this is its approximate location.

**next slide**

But let's switch topic now. On Monday evening we have a group dinner,
but if you arrive on Sunday or only fly back on Wednesday, you may 
be interested in finding good places to eat.

There are a few nice areas in Brussels with a high density of restaurants.
Of course, wherever there are many restaurants, there are good and bad ones,
so it may be worth to check the reviews. We'll walk through some areas,
but I've also made a list of recommendations and will discuss some of these
also.

**click** A first interesting area are a couple of streets close to the
"Halles Saint-Géry" and actually also close to the former stock exchange,
called "Beurs" in Dutch or "Bourse" in French. You'll also find a couple
of Asian restaurants there which may be the best choice for vegetarians
as many restaurants offer very few vegetarian dishes, let alone vegan food.

**click** The Place Sainte Catherine and the surrounding streets also
house many restaurants. Don't try the cheaper fish restaurants though
at the corner of the huge square called Vismarkt or Marché aux Poissons.
That square is currently actually one of the locations for the Christmass
market, though that name is not really used in Belgium to ensure that
people from a non-Christian background also feel welcome.

**click** There are also some decent to very good places in the 
Kolenmarkt or Rue du Marché au Charbon, a street that stretches from
the Grande-Place to the Fontainas square. It is also the gay street in
Brussels, but that only helps to make the street more busy and safe.
The list of restaurants that we made also contains some places there.

**click** Another nice area is the Oude Korenhuis or Vielle Halle aux Blés,
which is also home to the excellent craft beer bar GIST.

**click** And near the meeting venue, in the Onderrichtstraat or
Rue de l'Enseignement, there are also several nice restaurants, though some
have opening hours that really indicate they cater to the office workers
in the nearby administrative buildings.

**click** Most tourist guides will tell you about the Beenhouwersstraat
or Rue des Bouchers as a street worth visiting for restaurants. This street
and its extension, the Rue Gétry, is probably the biggest tourist trap
of Brussels when it comes to food. There are some honest and good places,
and even an excellent one, but be very careful. Most of the cheap places
are dishonest and ones you get inside, you may see a completely different
and higher priced menu. And the quality is sometimes very low.
The restaurant for the group dinner is in that street. It is one of the better
businesses in that street, but was also chosen because on Monday evening
there are not that many restaurants in Brussels that can house a group
our size that are open. Businesses that cater less to tourists, or 
where the owner wants to be on site most of the time, often have one or
two closing days, typically on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday.

**click** Finally, if you are travelling on a tight budget, you may 
consider the restaurants in or near the Kaasmarkt or Marché aux Fromages.
They are certainly not the best ones in Brussels, but in many of them
you do get very good value for the money taking into account that this is Brussels.
The Wolf food court which I did not show on this map could also be
an option, though there also not all stalls have the same quality.
Or you could just try one of the many stalls on the winter market as we
are December.

**next slide**

I want to make four special recommendations. These are places that I have 
visited, and where I have been with groups also, or where groups on two former
activities that we organised for the LUMI project have been and liked.

**click** On Sunday evening you can consider Café Charbon in the Kolenmarkt or
Rue Marché aux Charbon. It is more towards the Fontainas square. Especially
the daily specials can be very good. The place is closed on Tuesday though.

**click** If you are still thirsty after the meal, you can visit Moeder Lambic
Fontainas on the Fontainas square. This is a nice beer bar, and many of the 
people behind the bar are very helpful when selecting beers.
Order at the bar in this place.

**click** An option both on Sunday and Tuesday evening, is la Porteuse d'Eau.
This place is just outside the Pentagon, so it takes some walking, and some
of the streets you walk through may feel a bit dark. The restaurant is well 
worth a visit though. It is in an Art Nouveau building. Though the building is
not as spectacular as those of the famous architect Victor Horta, who built
several nice Art Nouveau buildings in Brussels that attract so many visitors
that you need a reservation to get in, it is still a nice place, and the food
is also very good. If the mussels are still on the menu, then this is definitely
a good place to get them. They also have a nice beer menu. And certainly pay a 
visit to the bathrooms on the first floor (British way of counting floors) as
it will take you through a nice room which especially on a sunny day is spectacular.

**click** If you are still thirsty afterwards, a taproom of Brasserie de l'Hermitage
is nearby. Not the best brewery in Brussels - I prefer La Source - but still 
a good place for a local beer. Order at the bar in this place.

**click** A third recommendation both for Sunday and Tuesday is
Fin de Sciècle, not too far from the stock exchange.
It is a relatively low-priced restaurant. Don't expect a fancy interior,
but it is very authentic. It is also a good place to have some very Belgian
dishes, including the "stoemp saucisses" which is popular in Brussels.
This is a dish of mashed potatos mixed with vegetables with saussages. 
It looks like the place is currently recommended in many tourist guides as
it has become extrememely busy. There is often a long waiting line to get
a seat and the place does not take reservations. The nearby restaurant
"9 et voisins" can be a nice alternative with similar food.

**click** A final recommendation but only for Tuesday evening, is the
Brasserie des Alexiens in the Cellebroersstraat or Rue des Alexiens.
It is at the location of a former monastery. It is a bit more classy.
Tables are a bit further apart. Prices are however very reasonable,
especially given that the quality of the food is generally very good.

**click** And if you're still thirsty afterwards, take the door to the
left of the front door of the restaurant that takes you down into a 
basement, likely the former basements of the monastery. It houses a
nice beer bar. Order at the bar, and it may be worth to also check
the bottle menu. A few copies are usually available at the bar.


**next slide**

However, regarding food, some warnings are in order.

**click** Proper Belgian fries are not vegetarian or vegan. They are
prepared in beef fat. So if a restaurant claims that their fries are
OK for vegetarians, they are either lying or it are not proper Belgian
fries. The fries in the restaurant for the group meal are proper Belgian
fries.

**click** Most waffles sold in Brussels are not proper Brussels waffles.
In fact, abroad one often talks about Belgian waffles, but there is no
such thing as a Belgian waffle. What they sell in the USA as Belgian waffles
does resemble the waffles that my mother made wen I was young with a 
recipe from the cookbook of the farmers' association. There are two 
famous waffles recipes in Belgium. One is the gauffre de Bruxelles or
Brussels waffle, and the other one is the gauffre de Liège. 
The Brussels waffle is very light and and is made from a fairly liquid dough. 
The waffle has a regular rectangular shape, because the liquid dough easily 
fills the entire waffle iron. However, the waffle has to be eaten very 
fresh and cannot really be reheated. Enter the gauffre de Liège.
This one is made from a drier dough that is pressed between the waffle iron.
As a result, it has a more irregular shape. It it also much denser
and contains a lot more sugar. But it can be reheated which makes it
so popular at the many waffle stands in the tourist centre.
As the Brussels waffle is so hard to make, it has in fact become very 
difficult to find a true Brussels waffle in Brussels and I can't really
recommend a place at the moment.

**click** Belgium has a very nice collaboration with the Netherlands.
They produce excellent mussels in the Oosterschelde an we eat them.
Mussels are a popular dish especially during the summer season, but many
restaurants will still serve them, and the quality is usually still
very good in December. A regular portion of mussels is 1.2 to 1.3kg,
while a small portion is 800 grammes. You will see that some cheap
places offer even smaller portions, and those are definitely not 
enough for an adult person unless you are not hungry at all.

**click** And lastly, as everywhere else, if it is too cheap to be true,
it is likely not true, or at least you get very small portions,
or an inferior quality of ingredients is used, or they try to get a 
very quick rotation, trying to get you out of the place in 20 minutes 
or half an hour. And often it is a combination of two or more of these.
Some of these places will still give you good value for more, but don't
expect more than you pay for.

**next slide**

As we discussed Belgian fries, I have trouble finding really good ones
in Brussels that are made 100% the way they should, letting them swim
in hot beef fat rather than cook them in a basket. However, it is still
worth experiencing some Belgian fries as a snack if you are not too
hungry or just want some cheap food.

**click** Many tourist guides will tell you to try Fritland or
Frituur Tabora, both close to the stock exchange. They are easy to
locate as during much of the day, there is a long waiting line.
I've tried Fritland and was not very enthousiastic.

**click** For a more authentic experience, I'd recommend Fritkot Chouke.
Unfortunately they have no seating inside but that is actually rather
typical for many of the authentic "Fritkots". It is located close to
the Place Sainte Catherine which we have discussed already.
Try the big fries with "stoofvlees saus" for the full experience of
Belgian fries. These are fries with a sauce of Flemish stew.

**next slide**

And lastly, of course people expect good beer in Belgium. The Brussels
region is nowadays home to many small breweries, and many of them do have
a taproom. Some suggestions:

**click** Brussels Beer Project started in the Rue Dansaert. Their
main brewery is now in a different location and only runs a taproom in
the summer months. But at the Dansaert location, they still have a 
taproom and brew some special beers. Check the opening days though as
it is not always open.

They also have a second taproom at the Avenue Louise, once a famous shopping
street, though the bar is a bit further down the street. 
It is called Brussels Beer Project Bailli and can be reached easily with
the tram from near the meeting venue.

**click** We've already mentioned the taproom of Brasserie de l'Hermitage
in Saint-Gilles. The brewery is in a different part of Brussels, but they
outgrew the taproom there.

**click** Also a bit outside the pentagon, and a place I'd prefer to go
to on an afternoon is the taproom and brewery of Brasserie La Senne,
named after the river flowing through or under Brussels.

**click** Very nearby is my personal favourite in Brussels, Brasserie La Source.
A bit hard to find though as it is inside a hall and not well indicated
at the street.

**click** If you want to learn about the history of the one kind of beer
for which this area is famous, Lambic and Geuze with the latter a mix of
several Lambics of different age, you can visit the Brasserie Cantillon and
their Geuze Museum. However, visiting them is only possible five days a week
from 10 till 5, and I'd recommend to go before 3 in the afternoon to have some 
time for tasting also.

**next slide**

The taprooms we discussed are often a bit far away for a quick beer if you
stay in a hotel in the city centre. There are three bars I'd like to 
recommend in the city centre rather than the bigger ones you'll find in
many tourist guides. We've already discussed the first two.

**click** Moeder Lambic Fontainas has a nice and diverse selection of beers
on tap, but as the name suggests, they also have a nice selection of Lambic
and Geuze beers. Keep in mind though that a good Lambic or Geuze is not
cheap, and it has a taste that not everybody can appreciate. So you may 
want to share with some at first to see if you like it. Order at the bar.

**click** La Porte Noire is a beer bar in the basement of a former monastery.
We've discussed the place before when discussing restaurants. 
Order at the bar, and also check their bottles.

**click** Finally, GIST is a real craft beer bar. They have a small selection
on tap, but again check their bottles also. I haven't really tried getting
any advice there from staff members, but I would expect most staff to be
capable of giving proper advice which beer to chose if you can explain which
kinds and tastes you like.


**next slide**

To conclude, and I've already mentioned it. In this time of the year you have
Christmass markets everywhere which in Belgium are often called winter markets.
Brussels is no exception, and it actually starts three days before our
meeting.

**click** Worth a visit is the light show projected on the city hall on 
the Grande-Place. It runs every half hour between 5 and 10pm,
though I'm not sure there is actually one that still starts at 10pm.

**click** Then there are also many food stalls and stalls with presents, spread
across several areas in the pentagon: Close to the former stock exchange,
on squares further down the big lane passing in front of the stock exchange,
and on the Place Sainte Catherine and nearby Vismarkt or Marché aus Poissons,
which is actually the largest part of the market.

The surrounding streets are actually also beautifully illuminated at this time
of the year.

**next slide**

So have a nie meeting!
