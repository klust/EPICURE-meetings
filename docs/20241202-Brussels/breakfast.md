# Breakfast places

Have a hotel without breakfast, and looking for something quick in the city
centre or near the meeting venue HOEK38?

## Near HOEK38

Both places below are on the little square that you likely pass on your way from the 
city centre and central station to the HOEK38 meeting venue.

-   [Leopold Café Royal](https://www.leopoldcaferoyal.com/)
    at [the start of the Leuvenseweg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5MgVZHinN9XR1fHQA)

-   [PAUL bakery](https://www.paul-belgium.be/nl/find-a-paul/enseignement)
    at [the start of the Onderrichtstraat/Rue de l'Enseignement](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Aaao7o5w9Px8h6mV7)
    is an easy place to pick up some food to bring into the venue,
    though you can eat in also.


## City centre

In the central station, there are a few places that sell sandwiches and the like.

If you want to avoid going in the station itself:

-   [Panos City Brussels](https://www.panos.be/nl/winkel/panos-brussel-23061) at the
    [Grasmarkt/Marché aux Herbes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GfB1QzApvajcLUBE9),
    a square between the famous Grote Markt/Grande Place and the central station
    is a good place to pick up a sandwich and a coffee. In the summer, you can eat
    on the terrace in front of the place, but that may be less comfortable during
    the EPICURE meeting.

-   [PAUL bakery](https://www.paul-belgium.be/nl/find-a-paul/fripiers)
    in de [Keerkopersstraat/Rue des Fripiers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/muUBWRRHmwZXew5w9)
    is a bakery where you can pick up some sandwiches or Viennese pastries and the like.
    In the summer, you can eat
    on the terrace in front of the place, but that may be less comfortable during
    the EPICURE meeting.
